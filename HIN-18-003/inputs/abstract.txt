Differential cross sections for the Drell-Yan process, including Z boson 
production, using the dimuon decay channel are measured in proton-lead (pPb) 
collisions at a nucleon-nucleon centre-of-mass energy of 8.16 TeV. A data 
sample recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC is used, corresponding to 
an integrated luminosity of 173 nb$^{-1}$. The differential cross 
section as a function of the dimuon mass is measured in the range 15-600 
GeV, for the first time in proton-nucleus collisions. It is also 
reported as a function of dimuon rapidity over the mass ranges 15-60 GeV 
and 60-120 GeV, and ratios for the p-going over the Pb-going beam 
directions are built. In both mass ranges, the differential cross 
sections as functions of the dimuon transverse momentum $p_\textrm{T}$ and 
of a geometric variable $\phi^{*}$ are measured, where $\phi^{*}$ highly 
correlates with $p_\textrm{T}$ but is determined with higher precision. In the Z mass region, the rapidity dependence of the data indicate a modification of the distribution of partons within a lead nucleus as compared to the proton case. The data are more precise than predictions based upon current models of parton distributions.
