comment: Differential cross sections for the Drell-Yan process, including Z boson
  production, using the dimuon decay channel are measured in proton-lead (pPb) collisions
  at a nucleon-nucleon centre-of-mass energy of 8.16 TeV. A data sample recorded with
  the CMS detector at the LHC is used, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of
  173 nb$^{-1}$. The differential cross section as a function of the dimuon mass is
  measured in the range 15-600 GeV, for the first time in proton-nucleus collisions.
  It is also reported as a function of dimuon rapidity over the mass ranges 15-60
  GeV and 60-120 GeV, and ratios for the p-going over the Pb-going beam directions
  are built. In both mass ranges, the differential cross sections as functions of
  the dimuon transverse momentum $p_\textrm{T}$ and of a geometric variable $\phi^{*}$
  are measured, where $\phi^{*}$ highly correlates with $p_\textrm{T}$ but is determined
  with higher precision. In the Z mass region, the rapidity dependence of the data
  indicate a modification of the distribution of partons within a lead nucleus as
  compared to the proton case. The data are more precise than predictions based upon
  current models of parton distributions.

  for $60<m_{\mu\mu}<120$ GeV, and i is the corresponding bin number in $\phi^*$.
  The global normalisation uncertainty of 3.5% is not included. Data from Figure [3,
  4, 4].
